Assignment #1- Reverse word with recursion
Algorithm
-honor code at top
-Import input/output and string libraries
-call reverse function in order to use it later
	-make sure it has input array and size arguments

-main:
	-create while loop for continue question at end
		-exit while loop by answering ‘N’, else keeps running main
	-set input variable to char type with an array max of 100 for 100 max characters
	-set size as int
	-ask the user for a string to reverse: print it to console
	-use scanf to get what they input, formatted as a string-set to input variable
	
	-set size = length of string – 1: because we will use this in reverse function in addition to an index number to determine char placement
	-call reverse function with arguments of input and size
	-print to console the input array as a reversed word
	
	-ask user if they would like to continue
	-if user inputs ‘N’, exit while loop and stop main

-reverse:
	-need to swap first and last letters until it gets to middle
	-once all letters swapped, end function
	-start by placing the first letter in a temporary variable
	-then set first letter in array = to last letter which will be input[size]
	-then set last letter in array to temp
	-when doing the recursion, subtract one from size 

	OR
	-create new temp array, since its pass by reference, with max of size
	-take last letter of input string, and add it to first slot of temp
	-go to next letter, add to second place in temp and so on,
	-when temp = size of input array, then set input array = temp array and end
